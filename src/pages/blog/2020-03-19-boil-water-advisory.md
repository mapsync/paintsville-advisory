**BOIL WATER ADVISORY**

DUE TO A LINE BREAK, ALTHOUGH NO CONTAMINATION HAS BEEN CONFIRMED, PAINTSVILLE UTILITIES HAS VOLUNTARILY ISSUED A BOIL WATER ADVISORY FOR THE FOLLOWING AREAS:

ALL OF GREEN VALLEY ROAD OFF OF KY RT 460 W.

THIS ADVISORY IS BEING ISSUED AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE AND IS IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

Paintsville Utilities is advising all customers in the affected areas to boil their water before using it for drinking, making ice, cooking, washing dishes, brushing teeth, or food preparation.
