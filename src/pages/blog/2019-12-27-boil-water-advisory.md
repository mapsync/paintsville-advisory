BOIL WATER ADVISORY 

December 27, 2019

DUE TO A LINE BREAK, ALTHOUGH NO CONTAMINATION HAS BEEN CONFIRMED, PAINTSVILLE UTILITIES HAS VOLUNTARILY ISSUED A BOIL WATER ADVISORY FOR THE FOLLOWING AREA along Rt 321 North beginning at Value Med Pharmacy and continuing to Jim Meek Drive just north of Little Caesars. This includes all of Apple Tree Plaza, and most of Mayo Plaza on the north side of Rt 321. The Food City section  of Mayo Plaza is NOT included in this advisory.

THIS ADVISORY IS BEING ISSUED AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE AND IS IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

Paintsville Utilities is advising all customers in the affected areas to boil their water before using it for drinking, making ice, cooking, washing dishes, brushing teeth, or food preparation. Bring all water to a rolling boil, let it boil for three minutes, and let it cool before using. Boiling kills bacteria and other organisms in the water.
