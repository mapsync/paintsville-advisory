BOIL WATER ADVISORY



Due to a line break, although no contamination has been confirmed, Paintsville Utilities has voluntarily issued a boil water advisory for the following area:



For part of RT 689 in the Flat Gap area beginning at the intersection of RT 689 and RT 1624 continuing to the intersection of RT 689 and RT 1092 including all hollows and side roads in between.



This advisory is being issued as a precautionary measure and is in effect until further notice. Paintsville Utilities is advising all customers in the affected areas to boil their water before using it for drinking, making ice, cooking, washing dishes, brushing teeth, or food preparation. Bring all water to a rolling boil, let it boil for three minutes, and let cool before using. Boiling kills bacteria and other organisms in the water.
