BOIL WATER ADVISORY

April 12, 2020

Due to a power outage at the pump station, although no contamination has been confirmed, Paintsville Utilities has voluntarily issued a boil water advisory for our customers on RT 40 East from the bottom of Spicy Mountain to the top of the hill, including Spring Knob and Bart Branch.

THIS ADVISORY IS BEING ISSUED AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE AND IS IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

Paintsville Utilities is advising all customers in the affected areas to boil their water before using it for drinking, making ice, cooking, washing dishes, brushing teeth, or food preparation. Bring all water to a rolling boil, let it boil for three minutes, and let it cool before using. Boiling kills bacteria and other organisms in the water.
