DUE TO NECCESSARY LINE REPAIR, ALTHOUGH NO CONTAMINATION HAS BEEN CONFIRMED, PAINTSVILLE UTILITIES HAS VOLUNTARILY ISSUED A BOIL WATER ADVISORY FOR THE FOLLOWING AREAS:

Beginning on RT 460 West at the Regional Detention Center and continuing along RT 460 to and including Verne Horne Drive. All hollows and side roads in between, including RT 2039 are included.

Other areas affected include:

\    RT 40 West from RT 460 to, and including, Hurricane Branch

\    Little Mud Lick from RT 40 to, but not including Rule Branch

\    Rt 172 from RT 40 to Ramey Branch, but not including Stone Coal

\    Rt 23 South from RT 460 to RT 825 and including RT 825



THIS ADVISORY IS BEING ISSUED AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE AND IS IN EFFECT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

Paintsville Utilities is advising all customers in the affected areas to boil their water before using it for drinking, making ice, cooking, washing dishes, brushing teeth, or food preparation. Bring all water to a rolling boil, let it boil for three minutes, and let it cool before using. Boiling kills bacteria and other organisms in the water
