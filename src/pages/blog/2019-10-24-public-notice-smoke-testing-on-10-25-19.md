 Public Notice



Paintsville Utilities will be performing smoke testing of the sewer system on 11th Street in  the area around Walnut and Washington Avenues on Friday, October 25.  We plan to begin around 1:00 pm. Light colored smoke may be seen coming from sewer vents on buildings, around foundations, from gutter downspouts, out of the ground, or in the event of faulty plumbing, possibly even from interior drains.  Smoke could also be visible along Broadway and 12th Street.

We advise customers in this area to run water prior to this testing in any drains which have not been used recently.  Please pay special attention to floor drains.  Only enough water to fill the trap is needed.

 The specially designed smoke for this purpose is non-toxic.
